// file structures and best practices in react

// most of the times we will create files and write codes inside src folder
// index.html is present inside public folder
// we do not needs to invoke scripts using <script> tag inside index.html, it gets automatically invoked because of react-scripts
        // dependency written inside package.json file
// we can write components file name starting with small or capital letter but best practice is write in starting letter with capital letter
// components function name should be starting with capital letter










function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello world from react !!!</h1>
  );
}

export default App;
